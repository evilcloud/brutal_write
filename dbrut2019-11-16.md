Another day, another try. Today I am trying to continue coding my **brutalist write** editor. At the same time I've started eyeing (dart)[https://dart.dev/] with the `flutter` framework for mobile development. If this thing ever to take off, it needs an iPad support.
Befor that, however, there are multiple things I need to do while still on Python:
1. set this whole thing up as a Project on GitHub
2. work up some statistics. Jupyter? Commandline? Browser? Decide
3. plug in some sentiment analysis API. Google AI thing looks pretty decent, but there are others too
4. think really nard on the output and syncronisation
5. at some point think of the user initialization and distro

basically I am still very far from jumping into mobile development. *Having said this*, I am considering rewriting the whole lot in `Ruby` for the ease of distribution's sake. Not the whole lot, but the ntry part, at least. The stats will still require `numpy` and `pandas`, so Python stays there for now.

oh, one more thing -- remove the freaking milliseconds from the `session_duration`~
